CREATE-FUNCTION()                                            CREATE-FUNCTION()



NAME
       create-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  Lambda function. The function metadata is created from
       the request parameters, and the code for the function is provided by  a
       .zip file in the request body. If the function name already exists, the
       operation will fail. Note that the function name is case-sensitive.

       If you are using versioning, you can also  publish  a  version  of  the
       Lambda  function you are creating using the Publish parameter. For more
       information about versioning, see AWS Lambda  Function  Versioning  and
       Aliases .

       This   operation  requires  permission  for  the  lambda:CreateFunction
       action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name you want to assign to the function you are  uploading.  The
          function  names appear in the console and are returned in the  List-
          Functions API. Function names are used to specify functions to other
          AWS  Lambda  API  operations, such as  Invoke . Note that the length
          constraint applies only to the ARN. If you specify only the function
          name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --runtime (string)
          The runtime environment for the Lambda function you are uploading.

          To use the Python runtime v3.6, set the value to "python3.6". To use
          the Python runtime v2.7, set the value to "python2.7".  To  use  the
          Node.js  runtime  v6.10,  set  the value to "nodejs6.10". To use the
          Node.js runtime v4.3, set the value to "nodejs4.3". To use the  .NET
          Core runtime v1.0, set the value to "dotnetcore1.0". To use the .NET
          Core runtime v2.0, set the value to "dotnetcore2.0".

          NOTE:
              Node v0.10.42  is  currently  marked  as  deprecated.  You  must
              migrate existing functions to the newer Node.js runtime versions
              available on AWS Lambda (nodejs4.3 or  nodejs6.10)  as  soon  as
              possible.  Failure  to do so will result in an invalid parameter
              error being returned. Note that you will  have  to  follow  this
              procedure for each region that contains functions written in the
              Node v0.10.42 runtime.


          Possible values:

          o nodejs

          o nodejs4.3

          o nodejs6.10

          o nodejs8.10

          o java8

          o python2.7

          o python3.6

          o dotnetcore1.0

          o dotnetcore2.0

          o dotnetcore2.1

          o nodejs4.3-edge

          o go1.x

       --role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  Lambda  assumes
          when  it  executes your function to access any other Amazon Web Ser-
          vices (AWS) resources. For more information, see AWS Lambda: How  it
          Works .

       --handler (string)
          The  function within your code that Lambda calls to begin execution.
          For Node.js, it is the module-name .*export* value in your function.
          For   Java,   it   can   be   package.class-name::handler  or  pack-
          age.class-name . For more information, see Lambda  Function  Handler
          (Java) .

       --code (structure)
          The code for the Lambda function.

    Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string,S3ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string",
            "S3ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --description (string)
          A short, user-defined function description. Lambda does not use this
          value. Assign a meaningful description as you see fit.

       --timeout (integer)
          The function execution time at which  Lambda  should  terminate  the
          function.  Because the execution time has cost implications, we rec-
          ommend you set this value based on your expected execution time. The
          default is 3 seconds.

       --memory-size (integer)
          The  amount  of memory, in MB, your Lambda function is given. Lambda
          uses this memory size to infer the amount of CPU  and  memory  allo-
          cated  to  your function. Your function use-case determines your CPU
          and memory requirements. For example,  a  database  operation  might
          need  less  memory  compared  to  an  image processing function. The
          default value is 128 MB. The value must be a multiple of 64 MB.

       --publish | --no-publish (boolean)
          This boolean parameter can be used to request AWS Lambda  to  create
          the Lambda function and publish a version as an atomic operation.

       --vpc-config (structure)
          If  your  Lambda  function  accesses resources in a VPC, you provide
          this parameter identifying the list of security group IDs and subnet
          IDs.  These  must  belong to the same VPC. You must provide at least
          one security group and one subnet ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string


       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --dead-letter-config (structure)
          The parent object that contains  the  target  ARN  (Amazon  Resource
          Name)  of an Amazon SQS queue or Amazon SNS topic. For more informa-
          tion, see  dlq .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetArn": "string"
          }

       --environment (structure)
          The parent object that  contains  your  environment's  configuration
          settings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Variables={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Variables": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }


       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key used to encrypt your
          function's environment variables. If not provided, AWS  Lambda  will
          use a default service key.

       --tracing-config (structure)
          The parent object that contains your function's tracing settings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "Active"|"PassThrough"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The list of tags (key-value pairs) assigned to the new function. For
          more information, see Tagging Lambda Functions  in  the  AWS  Lambda
          Developer Guide .

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --zip-file (blob)
          The  path  to  the  zip file of the code you are uploading. Example:
          fileb://code.zip

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
